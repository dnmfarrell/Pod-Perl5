=pod

In Perl5 pod, ordinary paragraphs are streams of text separated by an empty line.

Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks of text,
like this one. You can simply type in your text without any markup
whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and after. When it gets
formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being rewrapped,
probably put into a proportionally spaced font, and maybe even justified.

You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for bold, italic,
"code-style", hyperlinks, and more. Such codes are explained in the
"Formatting Codes" section, below.
